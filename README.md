# Homelab

Hello, welcome to the documentation of my personal homelab. In here you will find what I am currently working on. This may include the blemishes and unpolished functions as part of the process but that is the purpose. I built this homelab to experiment, learn, and gain real experience. Below is a dynamic list of my setup: first is hardware, then software. Eventually I will be adding a network configuration chart of my lab and by extension my home network as well.
